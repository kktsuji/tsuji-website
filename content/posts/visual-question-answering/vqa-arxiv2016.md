Summary (Generated by Microsoft Copilot):

**Introduction:**

- The paper addresses the issue of language bias in Visual Question Answering (VQA) and aims to elevate the role of image understanding.

**Challenges:**

- Existing VQA models often exploit language priors, leading to inflated performance without true visual understanding.

**Methods:**

- The authors create a balanced VQA dataset by collecting complementary images, ensuring each question has two images with different answers.

**Novelties:**

- Introduction of a balanced dataset that reduces language biases and a novel interpretable model providing counter-example based explanations.

**Results:**

- State-of-the-art VQA models perform significantly worse on the balanced dataset, confirming reliance on language priors.

**Performances:**

- Models trained on the balanced dataset show improved performance, indicating a need for larger, more balanced datasets.

**Limitations:**

- The dataset is not perfectly balanced, and some questions may not have suitable complementary images.

**Discussion:**

- The balanced dataset and counter-example explanations can help build trust in VQA models and push the field towards better visual understanding.
