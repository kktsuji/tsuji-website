## Me

I'm K. Tsuji. I'm a software engineer specialized digital signal image processing technology about CMOS image sensors. I work in image simulator development for a company specializing in semiconductor manufacturing from 2018 to the present.

And as a doctoral student who has a full time job since 2024, I research on medical imaging at a university laboratory. By applying generative AI technology to the medical imaging domain and improving computer-aided systems that support physicians' diagnosis, I contribute to patients' quality of life.
