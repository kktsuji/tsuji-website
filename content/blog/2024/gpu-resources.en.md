## Free Resources

### University Laboratory

* Pros:
    * It'd be the easiest and most flexible way to use.
    * There'd be a manual, member's support or something in laboratory.
* Cons:
    * The GPU quality depends on the laboratory's budget.
    * You may need to wait until resources become available during busy season.
    * The project would be less reproducible. Documentation must be carefully prepared when source code is to be public.

### Google's TPU Research Cloud

[TPU Research Cloud](https://sites.research.google/trc/about/) offers cloud machine resources to researchers for free.

* Pros:
    * Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is available free of charge.
* Cons:
    * Free 30-days access to TPU requires application and approval.
    * TPUs are free, but other Google Cloud Platform services such as storage for dataset are charged.
    * Pytorch (by Meta) can be used, but it is said that TensorFlow (by Google) is better than it, because tensorflow natively supports TPUs.

### Google Colab (Free Plan)

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

* Pros:
    * High reproducibility of your project.
* Cons:
    * Free plan has poor machine power and time limits.

## Paid Resources

### My Own GPU

* Pros:
    * It's free to use except for electricity once you purchase a GPU.
    * Always available.
* Cons:
    * GPUs are easily outdated because GPUs evolve so quickly.
    * Low GPU utilization is less cost-effective than on-demand use of cloud resources.
    * GPU can be broken.
    * Low reproducibility of your source code.

### Cloud Services

Consider costs.

* [Google Colab (Paid Plan)](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [GCP (Google Cloud Platform)](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome)
* [AWS (Amazon Web Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/)
* etc.
