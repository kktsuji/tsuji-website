This post summarizes notes from CVPR2024 papers that are not relevant to my area of research.

## Generative Image Dynamics

Paper: Li et al., Generative Image Dynamics ([project page](https://generative-dynamics.github.io/), [cvpr2024 open access](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_Generative_Image_Dynamics_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf) or [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07906)).

This paper won the [CVPR2024 best paper award](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024/News/Awards).

* They proposed a new diffusion-based method to generate loop videos containing motion trajectories from a single RGB image.
* Their model learns oscillatory dynamics of objects swaying by the wind from real video sequences.
* Motions are treated as spectral volumes in Fourier domain.

## BioCLIP

Paper: Stevens et al., BIOCLIP: A Vision Foundation Model for the Tree of Life ([project page](https://imageomics.github.io/bioclip/), [cvpr2024 open access](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Stevens_BioCLIP_A_Vision_Foundation_Model_for_the_Tree_of_Life_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf) or [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18803)).

This paper won the [CVPR2024 best student paper award](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024/News/Awards).

* They proposed a new dataset called “TREEOFLIFE-10M” containing biology images.
* They also proposed a new foundation model for the tree of life called “BIOCLIP”.
