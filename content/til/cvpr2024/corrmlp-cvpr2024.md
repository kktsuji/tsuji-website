## Novelties of the Paper

* Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) without self-attention is one of efficient methods in terms of computational costs and memory usages but it doesnâ€™t account for inductive bias.
* To solve this problem, authors proposed a registration method called correlation-aware MLP-based (CorrMLP) network.
* Two key points are a CNN-based hierarchical feature extraction encoder and a correlation-aware coarse-to-fine registration decoder.
*  Correlation-aware multi-window MLP (CMW-MLP) blocks in the later decoder treat multiple size features extracted by the former encoder, which makes CorrMLP possible to utilize fine-grained long-range features on full resolution images.
* CorrMLP can solve local non-linear and wide range deformations for image registration. 

## Performance Evaluation Methods

* They compared CorrMLP to other methods incluing SyN, NifyReg, VoxelMorph, Swin-CoxelMorph, TransMorph, TransMatch, LapIRN, ULAE-net, Dual-PRNet++, SDHNet, NICE-Net and NICE-Trans.
*  Dataset: ADNI, ABIDE, ADHD, IXI, Mindboggle and Buckner for 3D inter-patient brain image registration, ACDC for 4D intra-patient cardiac image registration.

## Discussions

* CorrMLP performed better than other methods (transformers, CNNs and MLPs) on the DSC and NJD indices.
* The both image-level and step-level correlations are necessary for the CorrMLP's best performans.

## What I learned

* Inductive bias is implemented by a combination of CNN (in the former encoder) and global average pooling (in the later decoder), I guess.
* MLPs doesn't take into account indactive bias.
* Transformer has the capability to capture wide-range features in an image, but it may difficult to treat fine-grained long-range dependences at the input image size since downsample features are commonly used to reduce computation and memory consumption.
