Summary (Generated by Microsoft Copilot):

**Introduction:**
- The paper explores **mechanistic interpretability** for medical imaging using a pathology foundation model.

**Challenges:**
- **Batch effects** in pathology images.
- **Polysemantic neurons** storing multiple concepts.

**Methods:**
- Analysis of features from a **ViT-Small encoder** on pathology images and spatial transcriptomics datasets.

**Novelties:**
- **Interpretable representation** of cell and tissue morphology and gene expression.

**Results:**
- **Embedding dimensions** capture complex pathology-related concepts.
- **Linear regression** models predict nuclear characteristics.

**Performances:**
- **Pearson correlation** of 0.51 to 0.91 for nuclear characteristics prediction.

**Limitations:**
- Preliminary investigation; further decomposition of concepts needed.

**Discussion:**
- **Generalizability** of embeddings across different datasets and modalities.
