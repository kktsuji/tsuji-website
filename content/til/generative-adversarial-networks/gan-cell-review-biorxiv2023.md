Summary (Generated by Microsoft Copilot):

**Introduction:**
- **Cell microscopy** is crucial for studying microorganisms but has limitations in data availability.
- **Generative adversarial networks (GANs)** can generate synthetic samples to augment data.

**Challenges:**
- **Data limitations** in cell microscopy due to intrinsic technique limitations and sample preparation challenges.
- **Lack of consensus** on performance metrics, baselines, and datasets.

**Methods:**
- Systematic review of **32 studies** using GANs for cell microscopy image augmentation.
- Analysis of **21 publicly available datasets**.

**Novelties:**
- Identification of **popular architectures** like StyleGAN and PathologyGAN.
- Highlighting the importance of **design good practices** and **gold standards**.

**Results:**
- **18 studies** focused on image augmentation as the main task.
- **Vanilla GAN loss** was the most popular adversarial loss.

**Performances:**
- **Inception score (IS)** and **Fr√©chet inception distance (FID)** are common performance metrics.

**Limitations:**
- **High risk of bias** due to single-person data collection and lack of suitable bias assessment tools.

**Discussion:**
- Emphasis on the need for **reproducibility and comparability** in experimental designs.
- **Challenges in evaluating GAN performance** due to varied metrics and lack of robust evaluation methods.
