John Sonmez, Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual


ImIortant points for me:

- Essence of software engineers are similar to medieval sword smith.
- We should treat our skills as products or services of our business even if we are employees.
- Narrower and deeper speciality is better than to keep options to decide our speciality.
- If we want to pay for a layer for consulting, we should find a specialist of a specific domain related to our problem (e.g. a layer who is a specialist of real estate matter).
- It is enough to find just one royal customer for a software engineer who want to get a good job.
