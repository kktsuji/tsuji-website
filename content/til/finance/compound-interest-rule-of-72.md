Rule of 72 is a simple fomula to calculate how long will it take for the value of investment to double, given a fixed interest rate. 

$ y = i \div r $

Where $ y, i, r $ represent a expected period [year], investment value [any currency], and a fixed annual interest rate [%] respectedly.

When we invest $100, the calculation results are following:

| Interest rate [%] \ Years | 0 | 1.5 | 3 | 6 | 12 | 24 | 48 | 72 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.0 | 100 | | | | | | | 100 |
| 1.0 | 100 | | | | | | | 200 |
| 1.5 | 100 | | | | | | 200 | |
| 3.0 | 100 | | | | | 200 | | |
| 6.0 | 100 | | | | 200 | | | |
| 12.0 | 100 | | | 200 | | | | |
| 24.0 | 100 | | 200 | | | | | |
| 48.0 | 100 | 200 | | | | | |
