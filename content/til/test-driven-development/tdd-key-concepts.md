The simple and powerful key concepts of test-driven development (TDD) are following:

* Write new code only if automatic tests have failed
* Delete duplication

These concepts lead to the following procedures:

1. Red: Write a small test code that will always fail.
2. Green: Write new code to make the test successful (any ugly code can be allowed in this process).
3. Refactor: Remove all of duplications and improve code quality.

Red, green and refactor are also core principles in test-driven development.
