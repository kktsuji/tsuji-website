## Download and Execute Bash Scripts from Github Gist

```bash
# Latest version without hash
curl -fsSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mwufi/gist-url/raw//script-name.sh | sh

# Specific version with hash
curl -fsSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mwufi/gist-url/raw/hash/script-name.sh | sh
```

## Curl Options

Generated by Google Gemini:

-fsSL are the options used with the curl command. Here's a breakdown of their necessity:

- -f (or --fail): This option is important because it prevents curl from displaying an HTML document containing an error message if the server returns an error. Without this option, the error HTML would be piped to sh, potentially causing issues. So, it's necessary for robust error handling.
- -s (or --silent): This option suppresses progress meter and error messages from curl. While not strictly necessary, it's recommended for cleaner output in the Colab environment.
- -S (or --show-error): When used with -s, it ensures that error messages are still displayed if curl encounters an error. This is useful for debugging installation issues. So, it's recommended to keep it.
- -L (or --location): This option handles redirects. If the script URL redirects to a different location, curl will follow the redirect and download the script from the correct location. This is crucial for ensuring the script is downloaded correctly.

In conclusion:

While technically only -L is absolutely necessary for the command to function correctly (by handling potential redirects), the other options (-fsS) are highly recommended for robust error handling, cleaner output, and debugging capabilities. Therefore, it's best practice to keep all the options (-fsSL) in the command for a smooth and reliable execution.
