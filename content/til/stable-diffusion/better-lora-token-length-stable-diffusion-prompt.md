## Better LoRA Token Length in Stable Diffusion Prompts

The fewer tokens for LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) trigger words in Stable Diffusion prompts, the better the performance.

- 1 token:
  - Lower learning complexity
  - More efficient training
  - Probably conflict to other tokens which means existing concepts
- 2 tokens:
  - Balanced learning complexity
  - Moderate training efficiency
  - Reduced conflict with existing concepts
- 3 tokens or more:
  - Higher learning complexity
  - Less efficient training
  - Fewer conflicts with existing concepts
