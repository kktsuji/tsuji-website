## Commas in Token Analysis for Stable Diffusion Prompts

Commas play a significant role in token analysis for Stable Diffusion prompts. It is said to be highly recommended to include commas in prompts to ensure accurate tokenization.

Recommended:

```text
"LORA_TRIGGER_WORD, person, on house, in the forest"
```

Not Recommended:

```text
"LORA_TRIGGER_WORD person on house in the forest"
```

### Token Separation

- Tokenizer processes each element separated by commas as distinct tokens.
- Avoid the risk of being treated as a combined token with LORA_TRIGGER_WORD and other elements by using commas effectively.

### Clear Weight Assignment

- Stable Diffusion weights each token separately.
- Using commas allows for clear and precise weight assignment to each token.

### Stable Training

- Control the same token structure when training and generating images.
- Relatively easier to get stable results for the same prompt.
