Summary:

- Authors proposed a multimodal pretraining strategy called "MADELEINE", a slide representation learning method, leveraging multiple stained slides images for richer training.
- Trained MADELEINE encoder can be used for some downstream tasks such as few-shot classification, prognostication and fine-tuning.
- Training process utilizes a dual global-local cross-stain alignment objective with breast cancer samples and kidney transplant samples.

**Introduction:**

- The paper introduces **Madeleine**, a multimodal pretraining strategy for slide representation learning in computational pathology.

**Challenges:**

- Existing methods are limited by the **clinical and biological diversity** of views and the **scale of whole-slide images (WSIs)**.

**Methods:**

- Madeleine uses a **dual global-local cross-stain alignment objective** on large cohorts of breast and kidney samples.

**Novelties:**

- Introduces a **multimodal pretraining strategy** leveraging multiple stains as different views to form a rich training signal.

**Results:**

- Demonstrates the quality of slide representations on various downstream evaluations, including **morphological and molecular classification**.

**Performances:**

- Madeleine outperforms existing methods in **few-shot classification** and **full classification** tasks.

**Limitations:**

- The study does not involve datasets used for downstream tasks, precluding any data leakage.

**Discussion:**

- Highlights the importance of using clinically and biologically meaningful views provided by multimodal pretraining.
